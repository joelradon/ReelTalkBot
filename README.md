---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:

- **Go** (v1.20 or later): [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **AWS Account:** For AWS S3 integration.
- **Telegram Account:** For managing your Telegram bot.
- **OpenAI API Key:** To access OpenAI's language models. [Get an API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelradon/ReelTalkBot-Go.git
cd ReelTalkBot-Go
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.20 or later). Then, fetch the required dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

*Note: If you encounter issues with dependencies, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.*

---

## 🔧 Configuration

The bot requires several environment variables to function correctly. You can manage these using a `.env` file.

### 1. Create a `.env` File

In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

### 2. Define Environment Variables

Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and add the following variables:

```env
# Telegram Bot Token
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# OpenAI Endpoint (optional, defaults to OpenAI's API)
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com

# Telegram Bot Username (without @)
BOT_USERNAME=YourBotUsername

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=https://s3.your-region.amazonaws.com # Modify if using a custom endpoint

# AWS S3 Bucket Name
BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name

# NO_LIMIT_USERS (Comma-separated user IDs without spaces for no rate limit)
NO_LIMIT_USERS=12345678,87654321

# KNOWLEDGE_BASE (Set to ON to enable Knowledge Base queries)
KNOWLEDGE_BASE=OFF

# KNOWLEDGE_BASE_TRAIN_ENDPOINT (Optional, for training)
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_TRAIN_ENDPOINT=https://your-knowledgebase-app.fly.dev/api/knowledge
```

**Ensure you replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and configurations.**

### 3. Secure Your `.env` File

To prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
# .gitignore

# Environment Variables
.env
```

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Bot

Once you've installed the dependencies and configured the environment variables, you can run the bot using the following command:

```bash
go run ./cmd/main.go
```

*Alternatively, you can build the project and run the executable:*

```bash
go build -o ReelTalkBot ./cmd/main.go
./ReelTalkBot
```

**Note:** Ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured in your environment or via AWS configuration files to allow the bot to access the S3 bucket.

## 📈 Logging to AWS S3

ReelTalkBot logs all user interactions to an AWS S3 bucket in CSV format. Each log entry includes:

- `userID`: Telegram user ID
- `username`: Telegram username
- `prompt`: User's message
- `responseTimeMS`: Time taken to generate a response in milliseconds
- `queryCount`: Number of queries in the last 10 minutes
- `isRateLimited`: Indicates if the user is currently rate-limited

### 1. Set Up AWS S3 Bucket

1. **Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket (e.g., `reeltalkbot-logs`).
   - Configure permissions and access policies as needed.

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   - Ensure that your AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) are set in your environment or via AWS configuration files.
   - Alternatively, use IAM roles if deploying on AWS infrastructure.

### 2. Verify Logging

After running the bot, navigate to your S3 bucket and check the `logs/telegram_logs.csv` file to ensure that logs are being recorded correctly.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **1. Go Module Errors**

If you encounter issues related to `go.mod`, such as invalid module paths or versions:

- **Ensure Correct Module Paths:**  
  Verify that all module paths in `go.mod` are accurate and refer to existing modules.

- **Clear Module Cache:**
  ```bash
  go clean -modcache
  ```

- **Set Go Proxy:**
  ```bash
  go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
  ```

- **Fetch Dependencies Again:**
  ```bash
  go get -u ./...
  go mod tidy
  ```

### **2. Duplicate Method Declarations**

If you receive errors about duplicate method declarations:

- **Review Code for Duplicates:**  
  Open the affected `.go` files and ensure that each method is uniquely defined.

- **Remove or Rename Duplicates:**  
  If a method is defined multiple times, remove the redundant ones or rename them to reflect different functionalities.

### **3. AWS S3 Logging Issues**

If logs are not appearing in your S3 bucket:

- **Verify AWS Credentials:**  
  Ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions to write to the S3 bucket.

- **Check Bucket Configuration:**  
  Confirm that the bucket name and region are correctly specified in the `.env` file.

- **Review Application Logs:**  
  Check the bot's logs for any errors related to AWS S3 operations.



### **4. Telegram Bot Not Responding**

If the bot isn't responding to messages:

- **Verify Webhook Setup:**  
  Ensure that your Telegram bot's webhook is correctly set to your server's URL.

  ```bash
  https://api.telegram.org/bot<TELEGRAM_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>/webhook
  ```

- **Check Server Accessibility:**  
  Ensure that your server is publicly accessible and that no firewall rules are blocking Telegram's requests.

- **Review Application Logs:**  
  Look for any errors or warnings in the bot's logs that might indicate issues with message handling.

# Training the ReelTalkBot with the /learn Command

## Overview

The `/learn` command in the ReelTalkBot application allows authorized users to train the bot with new knowledge entries. This feature enhances the bot's capabilities by adding relevant information that can be retrieved in future interactions. Users can input training data related to bodies of water, fish species, water types, question templates, and answers.

## How to Use the /learn Command

### Prerequisites

- You must be an authorized user to access the training feature. Authorized users are defined in the environment variable `NO_LIMIT_USERS` within the bot's configuration.
- Ensure the knowledge base feature is activated by setting the environment variable `KNOWLEDGE_BASE` to `ON`.

### Command Format

The `/learn` command should be formatted as follows:

```
/learn [training data]
```

- **training data**: This is the information you want to teach the bot. It should include relevant details such as the body of water, fish species, water type, question template, and the corresponding answer.

### Example Usage

To train the bot with a new knowledge entry, you might use the command like this:

```
/learn I want to learn about the Salmon River. What species are common here? The common species include King Salmon and Coho Salmon.
```

### Command Breakdown

1. **Trigger Command**: Start with the `/learn` command to indicate that you want to train the bot.
2. **Provide Training Data**: Follow the command with a clear and structured training sentence that includes:
   - A reference to the body of water (e.g., "Salmon River").
   - The question template or the question you want the bot to recognize.
   - The answer or information related to the question.

## Bot Response

After submitting the `/learn` command with training data, the bot will respond with a confirmation message, indicating that the training data has been received and is being processed. Here’s what you might expect:

```
Training data received and is being processed.
```

If you are not authorized, the bot will respond with:

```
You are not authorized to train the knowledge base.
```

If the knowledge base feature is turned off, the response will be:

```
Knowledge base training is currently disabled.
```

## Important Notes

- **Rate Limits**: Authorized users may still be subject to rate limits defined in the application. For example, the bot limits queries to 10 per 10 minutes.
- **Message Formatting**: Ensure that your training data is clear and concise to avoid confusion during the training process.
- **Error Handling**: If there’s an error in processing the training data, the bot will inform you with an appropriate error message.

## Conclusion

Using the `/learn` command is a powerful way to enhance the ReelTalkBot's knowledge and responsiveness. By adding specific information through training, users can make the bot a more effective assistant for inquiries related to fishing and aquatic life.
